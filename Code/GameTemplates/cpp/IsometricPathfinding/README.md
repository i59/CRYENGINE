# Template Description
This directory containg the source code for the Isometric Pathfinding template originally based on GameZero.

The sample implements an isometric view and pathfinding for the player character based on mouse clicks.

## Future Extractions
The sample aims to extract additional logic into the engine itself, in order to minimize the amount of code required to get started.

Logic intended to be moved out are as follows:
* CEditorGame
* CNativeEntityBase
* CNativeEntityPropertyHandler
* CEnvironmentProbeEntity
* CLightEntity
* CFlowGameEntityNode
* CGameFactory helpers
* StringConversions.h
